-- Problem:
-- Write a function `angularOffsetSign` that takes in inputs `startAngle` and 
-- `goalAngle` and returns the direction `startAngle` must be rotated towards
-- in order to become `goalAngle`. 
--
-- Note that there are two ways to get to an angle from any other angle; you may 
-- go clockwise or counterclockwise from `startAngle` to reach `goalAngle`. The
-- optimal choice will be the direction that requires the least amount of 
-- rotation.
--
-- Both `startAngle` and `goalAngle` are represented in radians.
--
-- Have the function return -1 if the the clockwise path is shorter than 
-- the counterclockwise path, 1 if the counterclockwise path is shorter than the 
-- clockwise path, and 0 if the clockwise path is as long as the 
-- counterclockwise path. Do not assume all inputs will always be between 0 and 
-- 2pi.

function angularOffsetSign(startAngle, goalAngle)
